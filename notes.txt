// Pig Dice //

Rules:
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, 
but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score.


First action of the game:

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".

Program needs to:

Generate random numbers between 1-6.



function playerRoll();
  - If "1" - play is passed to player 2

  - If 2-6 - add that number to the accumulator variable.
        - If 'accumulator variable' === "100"
        -then, current player wins game






roll = 3



// Ideas for Functions //
function Contact(firstName, lastName, score) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
  this.score = score;
}



function randomNum()  {
  math.random();
  return random;
}





function playerRoll(random);
  let roll = random
  let player1Total = 0

  if (roll === 1) {
    then turn passes to player 2;
  }
  else (roll === 2-6)  {
    add roll to player1Total;
  }





"It will evaluate randomly generated to see if equal to 1"

function randomNum() {
  let roll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 7);
    if (roll === 1) {
      return false
    } else if (roll )
}
